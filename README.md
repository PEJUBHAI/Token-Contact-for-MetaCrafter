# Project Title

Simple Token Contract


## Description

This project contains a simple Solidity smart contract for creating and managing tokens. It includes functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, follow these steps:

Download the Solidity contract file (`Token.sol`) to your local machine.

Make sure you have a Solidity development environment set up. You can use tools like Remix or Truffle for development.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract, you can follow these steps:

Deploy the `Token` contract to a supported blockchain network, such as Ethereum.

Initialize the contract by providing the token name, symbol, and initial supply.

Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and allocate them to specific addresses.

Use the `burn` function to destroy existing tokens, provided that the sender has enough tokens to burn.

## Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions, you can refer to the Solidity documentation or seek assistance from the Ethereum community.
